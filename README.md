## Features

### Existing Features

#### Home Page

  * The home page consists of a heading, a short but clear description of the quiz, and a clickable "PLAY" button that will start the game. The background image is colorful and shows characters from the tv show, and the container holding the content has therefore been kept simple to make it easy to read.

#### Quiz Page

* **Score Counter**

   *  At the top of the question container, the user can keep track of the scores. As presented on the home page, a correct answer will give the user 10 points and the score counter will update accordingly.

* **Question and Alternatives**

   * Below the score counter, the user will find the question with four clickable answer alternatives. If the user gets answers correctly, the alternative will turn green. If the user answer is incorrect, the alternative will turn red. After an answer alternative is clicked, the next question will show up automatically. There is a total of 10 questions and the order in which they appear is random.
